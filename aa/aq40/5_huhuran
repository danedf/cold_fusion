Use Tranquilizing Shot whenever she enrages BEFORE she is at 30% HP.
When she is enraged she will start shooting Poison Bolts at the nearest 15 players.

At 30% HP, the boss will *permanently* enrage.
At this point, she will continuously shoot Poison Bolts at the nearest 15 players until the encounter ends.

|cblueDPS|r: Use your big offensive and defensive cooldowns once the boss is at 30% HP.

{healer} Healers:
  Do **NOT** dispel Wyvern Sting on the raid (only dispel the Main Tank). If you do, you will severely damage the player.

{warrior}|cwarriorWarriors|r:
  Do not use Recklessness on this fight.

|cblueSoakers|r:
  You should have 150+ Nature Resistance unbuffed
