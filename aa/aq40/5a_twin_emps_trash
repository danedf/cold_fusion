Anubish Defender Assignments


These mobs can have multiple nasty abilities, such as school spell reflection, add summoning and thunderclaps, but the three main abilities you need to be aware of are:

  |credMeteor|r, which causes huge damage to a player, split amongst all nearby players.
  |cgreenPlague|r, which makes a player radiate nature damage to nearby allies.
  |cyellowExplode|r, which is cast at low health and will kill any nearby players upon completion.

Against Meteor, you want to have your group stacked, as any small groups of players hit by it will die instantly.

However, any player with |cgreenPlague|r must separate themselves from the group to avoid raid damage.

Finally, make sure you save your best damage abilities for when they start casting |cyellowExplode|r.
Failing to kill them before the cast finishes can result in a lot of deaths.
