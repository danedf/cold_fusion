  All  {dps} DPS need to reset  {icon spell_fire_fireball} Flame Buffet stacks around 4-8 using line of sight. Use {icon inv_misc_bandage_12} bandages while doing so to help healers. Ranged should be at 5 Max unless you pop a Greater Fire Protection Potion. Melee can judge stacks based on health and GFPP.

  It is possible for range to avoid getting stacks altogether but need to be prepared to line of sight in order to reset them if they get too high.
